# BAS API Guidelines

## Status

This project is now obsolete and no longer maintained. This project is retained for reference and in case it's useful to others.

BAS Staff are recommended to follow the advice provided and maintained by the (UK) Government Digital Service (GDS), older versions of which were included in these guidelines.

Specifically refer to [API technical and data standards (v2 - 2019)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards).

## Available formats

These guidelines are available in three formats

* Markdown - the definitive [1] and "working" file format in which all changes should be made [2]

* Microsoft Word - a release only format with suitable typesetting and layout for printing

* PDF - a release only format suitable for achieving, created from the Microsoft Word format

[1] Where differences exist between different formats, the markdown format is considered authoritative.

[2] The markdown format is available in two forms. The first is the full, complete guidelines, the second removes the contents of each guideline (and any other unreleased information).

## Creating alternate formats

### Microsoft word

3. Change the document theme to the word default styles

4. Adjust headings as follows:

    * Title:

    	  * Space after: `20`

	* Heading 1:

		* Space after: `15`

		* Space after: `10` 

		* Set font weight to `normal` (i.e. not bold)
